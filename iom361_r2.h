 *
 * This is the header file for the ECE 361 I/O module emulation.  The I/O module
 * emulates a memory-mapped I/O system with a number of "typical" peripheral registers.
 *
 */

 /**
 * Register formats:
 * -----------------
 *
 *	o switches[31:0]:	One bit per switch starting w/ bit[0] (rightmost, LSB).  Number
 *						of switches is specified in iom361_initialize().  Max of 32 switches.
 *						A switch is on for every bit that is 1
 *
 *	o leds[31:0]:		One bit per LED starting with bit[0] (rightmost, LSB. Number
 *						of LEDS is specified in iom361_initialize(). Max of 32 LEDS.
 *						An LED is on (lit) for every bit that is 1.  Contents of LED
 *						register is displayed on every write to the register.  Format is
 *						'o' for every lit LED.  '_' for every dark LED.
 *
 * o rgb_led[31:0]:		Control register for RGB LED.  Formatted as follows:
 * <pre>
 *	- bits[31:31]:  Enable - true if RGB outputs are enabled
 *	- bits[30:24]:	*reserved*
 *	- bits[23:16]:	8-bit duty cycle for Red segment
 *	- bits[15:8]:	8-bit duty cycle for Green segment
 *	- bits[7:0]:	8-bit duty cycle for Blue segment
 * </pre>
 *
 * o temperature[31:0]:	Temperature in degrees C.  iom361 emulates an AHT0
 *						temperature/humidity sensor.  Temperature is 24-bit
 *						number that can be converted to a float with the following formula:
 *							Temp(degrees C) = (ST/2**20) * 200 - 50
 *								where ST is the value in the register.
 *
 * o humidity[31:0]:	Relative humidity in %.  iom361 emulates an AHT0 temperature/humidity
 *						sensor.  Humidity is 24-bit number that can be converted to a float
 * 						with the following formula:
 *							Rel Humidity(%) = (SRH/2**20) * 100
 *								where SRH is the value in the register.
 *
 * o reserved_1[31:0]:	Reserved for future use.  Can be written and read
 *
 * o reserved_2[31:0]:	Reserved for future use.  Can be written and read
 *
 * o reserved_3[31:0]:	Reserved for future use.  Can be written and read
