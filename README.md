This is a repo for HW5 of ECE361 Fall 2024 term as solved by Crow.
This entire term I typically worked out of nano and terminal because they tend to be more friendly on my laptop, but for this final homework I used JetBrain's Clion IDE.
Using Clion ended up being an excellent IDE to use which also had the added support of making documentation easy and pushing to github.
In the past I have also used cli git controls for repo pulls, etc...

Thank you for a wonderful term!
